            4. Do not include any additional fields
            5. Do not return a JSON string, return a Python dictionary
            6. For missing information, use empty lists [] for list fields, empty string "" for string fields, and 0.0 for the total
            7. Do not include any comments or explanations in the output
            8. The output must be a valid Python dictionary that can be directly used to create an Invoice object
            9. For ANY value, if the value cannot be analysed from the input data, that value is a string: "None"
            10. For the invoice notes and payment notes, include the ALL TEXT in the note
            11. For taxes and extra charges, do not try to add the values yourself i.e. Late fee ($10), the values will be added by another function
            12. For the Items, only include the RAW ITEMS excluding amounts and pricaaaa

            {invoice_text} 

            Make a professional legal analysis on said invoice text, to ensure that it is legally compliant.
            Assess on how compliant the invoice information is to the following legal guidelines:
            {legal_data}

            Use the provided legal guidelines as a guide, but also do your own further research to ensure correctness.

            TAKE INTO ACCOUNT any relevant information under "Transaction notes:"

            If any fields have nothing or are listed as "string", treat them as if there is NO INFORMATION in the field.
        
            your analysis MUST revolve around THE NATURE OF THE TRANSACTIONS and the COUNTRIES of both SENDER and RECIPIENT.
            this is of utmost importance as the invoice must be legally compliant for BOTH COUNTRIES.

            AND, the nature of the transaction must also be carefully identified as certain invoice laws
            change depending on the transaction. for example, LOANS are EXEMPT from VAT under certain laws.

            NOTE the desceription of the transaction, some countries may require a detailed description while others may not.

            IGNORE the lack of INVOICE NUMBER, it will be automatically generated by a different agent.
            IGNORE the lack of an issue date, it will automatically be generated by a different agent

            Return ONLY the legal analysis as a string. Do not try to recreate the entire invoice data.
            Your response will be added to the 'legal' field of the existing invoice data.

            IMPORTANT: if ALL invoice transactions are exempt from things such as VAT, sales tax, SST, etc.
            then information MANDATORY for said things like a VAT number is NOT mandatory. 

            in that case, mention that the information IS MISSING, but not required.

            The output should be easy to understand and the user should be able to clearly read the analysis
            and intuitively be able to address the issues. Output should NEVER be vague.
            AVOID unsure statements such as "might,maybe etc" where possible.

            IF details are not provided and are NOT mandatory due to the nature of transactions,
            clearly state WHAT details are exempt.

            Output should also be concise, without sacrificing detail and information.
