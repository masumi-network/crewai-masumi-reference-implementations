# Contract Creator AI ü§ñüìÑ

A smart contract creation service that helps you generate legally-checked NDAs, Freelance, and Employment contracts using AI. Built with CrewAI and Masumi Network for secure, blockchain-based payments.

## What's This All About?

Ever spent hours drafting contracts or paid hefty legal fees for standard agreements? This tool helps you create professional, legally-sound contracts in minutes. It's like having a team of legal experts at your fingertips, but way cheaper and available 24/7.

### Features

- üìã Three contract types:
  - NDAs (when you need to keep things hush-hush)
  - Freelance Agreements (for your next awesome contractor)
  - Employment Contracts (time to grow the team!)
- ‚öñÔ∏è Legal compliance checks built-in
- üîç Risk assessment included
- üìù Professional PDF generation
- üí∏ Pay-per-use with crypto (ADA)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You'll need:
- Python 3.10 or newer (but not 3.13+ yet)
- PostgreSQL 15
- Node.js v18+
- A Blockfrost API key (for Cardano blockchain stuff)

### Quick Setup

1. Clone and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd contract-creator-ai
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set up your environment:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` with your details:
```ini
# OpenAI - You need this for the AI magic
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Masumi Payment Service
PAYMENT_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:3001/api/v1
PAYMENT_API_KEY=your_payment_key

# Agent Config
AGENT_IDENTIFIER=your_agent_id
PAYMENT_AMOUNT=10000000
PAYMENT_UNIT=lovelace
```

3. Start the services:
```bash
# Start Masumi Payment Service
docker compose up -d

# Start the Contract Creator API
python main.py api
```

## Using the Service

### Creating a Contract

Send a POST request to `/start_job` with your contract details:

```json
{
    "contract_type": "freelance",
    "company_name": "Cool Tech Inc",
    "company_address": "123 Startup St, SF",
    "party_name": "Jane Developer",
    "party_email": "jane@dev.com",
    "start_date": "2024-03-01",
    "hourly_rate": 150,
    "project_scope": "Build an awesome API"
}
```

### What Happens Behind the Scenes?

   - Contract Specialist drafts the initial agreement

   - Final Reviewer does a thorough check
   - Document Formatter makes it look professional

2. You get back:

   - You get a professional PDF
   - Everything is legally checked and ready to use
